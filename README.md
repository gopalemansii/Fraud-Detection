# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System
### Handling Highly Imbalanced Data with Machine Learning

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a **highly imbalanced real-world dataset**.

Fraud detection is a critical financial security problem where:

- Fraud cases are extremely rare (~0.17%)
- Missing a fraud (False Negative) leads to financial loss
- High false positives harm customer experience
- Accuracy alone is misleading

This project focuses on **cost-sensitive learning**, **class imbalance handling**, and **business-driven evaluation metrics**.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Financial institutions process millions of transactions daily. Even a small fraud detection failure rate can lead to significant losses.

The goal is to:

- Detect fraudulent transactions accurately
- Minimize False Negatives (avoid financial loss)
- Maintain reasonable False Positives (avoid customer friction)
- Use evaluation metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets

## 📊 Dataset Information

**Dataset:** Credit Card Fraud Detection (Kaggle)

- 284,807 transactions
- 30 features
  - V1–V28 (PCA-transformed features)
  - Time
  - Amount
  - Class (Target)

Target variable:

- `0` → Legitimate
- `1` → Fraud

### Class Distribution

| Class       | Count   | Percentage |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Legitimate | 284,315 | 99.83%     |
| Fraud      | 492     | 0.17%      |

This represents an **extremely imbalanced classification problem**.

---

## ⚠️ Why Accuracy is Misleading

If a model predicts all transactions as legitimate:

- Accuracy = 99.83%
- Fraud detection rate = 0%

Therefore, this project evaluates models using:

- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC
- PR-AUC (preferred for imbalanced data)
- Confusion Matrix

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

- Checked for missing values
- Standardized `Amount` feature using StandardScaler
- Stratified train-test split
- Feature engineering (if applicable)
- No data leakage ensured

---

### 2️⃣ Handling Class Imbalance

Multiple techniques were implemented and compared:

- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- Random UnderSampling
- Class Weight adjustment
- Threshold tuning (custom decision threshold)
- Precision-Recall curve optimization

---

### 3️⃣ Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression (with class_weight)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection approach)

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation Strategy

Primary optimization focus:

> Maximize Recall (Fraud class) while maintaining acceptable Precision.

Key Metrics:

- Confusion Matrix
- Recall (Fraud Detection Rate)
- Precision
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- PR-AUC Score

---

## 🏆 Best Model Performance

Best performing model:

**XGBoost with SMOTE + Threshold Tuning**

- ROC-AUC: ~0.98+
- High Recall for Fraud class
- Balanced Precision-Recall tradeoff
- Reduced False Negatives significantly


## 📊 Business Impact Perspective

In real-world systems:

- False Negative (FN) → Direct financial loss
- False Positive (FP) → Customer dissatisfaction & operational cost

This project prioritizes reducing False Negatives while controlling False Positives to maintain business balance.
